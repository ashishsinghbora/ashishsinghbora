       🐧 Linux Distros: I'm a bit of a Linux nomad, always hopping between distros to see what's out there. From Arch to Ubuntu, I love the thrill of trying something new and seeing where it takes me.
   </br> </br>
       🎵 Music Lover: When I'm not knee-deep in code or glued to a manga, you can bet I've got my headphones on, grooving to my favorite tunes. Music is my escape, my inspiration, and my constant companion.
    </br></br>
       🌸 Anime & Manga Fan: Ah, anime and manga—my ultimate guilty pleasure! There's nothing quite like getting lost in the colorful characters and captivating stories of the manga world. Give me a good manga series, and I can easily spend hours devouring chapter after chapter.
    </br></br>
       📚 Manga Marathoner: Yep, I've been known to pull an all-nighter just to finish a particularly gripping manga series. When I'm in the zone, time flies, and before I know it, I've spent the whole day lost in the pages of a manga.
    </br></br>
       💡 Tech Tinkerer: Beyond consuming content, I love to get my hands dirty and create cool tech stuff. Whether it's coding up a new project or experimenting with the latest gadgets, I'm always up for a challenge.
